# ESP32 Soccer Table Controller

A smart soccer table (foosball) controller built with ESP32 that features automatic goal detection using IR sensors and LED strip celebrations with team-specific colors.

## 🏆 Features

- **Automatic Goal Detection**: IR sensors in each goal detect when a ball passes through
- **LED Strip Celebrations**: 5-meter WS2812B LED strip displays team-specific color waves when goals are scored
- **Non-blocking Architecture**: All systems run simultaneously without delays
- **Team Colors**: Team A (Yellow) vs Team B (Orange) celebrations

## ⚽ How It Works

1. **Normal Mode**: LED strip cycles through beautiful demo effects (white, color waves, rainbow, breathing)
2. **Goal Detection**: IR sensors detect when the ball blocks the beam in either goal
3. **Celebration**: Immediate 3-second team-colored LED celebration wave
4. **Return to Normal**: Demo effects resume after celebration

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

### Components
- **ESP32 Development Board** (ESP32-DevKit or similar)
- **WS2812B LED Strip** - 5 meters, 60 LEDs/meter (300 total LEDs)
- **2x IR Reflective Sensors** - For goal detection (e.g., TCRT5000)
- **5V Power Supply** - For LED strip (calculate based on LED count)
- **Jumper Wires** and **Breadboard**

### LED Strip Layout
The 5-meter strip is divided into 4 sections around the table perimeter:
- Section 1: 120cm (72 LEDs) - LEDs 0-71
- Section 2: 70cm (42 LEDs) - LEDs 72-113  
- Section 3: 120cm (72 LEDs) - LEDs 114-185
- Section 4: 70cm (42 LEDs) - LEDs 186-227
- Unused: 72 LEDs (228-299)

## 🔌 Wiring Diagram

```
ESP32 Pin 2  → LED Strip Data In
ESP32 Pin 18 → IR Sensor Goal 1 (Team A - Red)
ESP32 Pin 19 → IR Sensor Goal 2 (Team B - Blue)
5V Supply    → LED Strip VCC
GND          → LED Strip GND + IR Sensors GND + ESP32 GND
3.3V         → IR Sensors VCC
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Platform Setup
- Install [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) or use PlatformIO extension in VS Code
- Clone or download this repository

### 2. WiFi Configuration
Edit `src/wifi-controller.cpp` and update your WiFi credentials:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

### 3. Hardware Configuration
If using different pins, update the pin definitions in the header files:
```cpp
// In include/led-controller.h
#define LED_PIN 2

// In include/ir-controller.h  
#define IR_SENSOR_GOAL_1_PIN 18
#define IR_SENSOR_GOAL_2_PIN 19
```

### 4. Upload Code
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer
2. Open the project in PlatformIO
3. Build and upload: `pio run --target upload`
4. Open Serial Monitor: `pio device monitor` (baud rate: 9600)

## 🎮 Usage

### Normal Operation
1. Power on the system
2. Wait for WiFi connection (check Serial Monitor)
3. LED strip will show white light initially
4. Demo effects cycle every 10 seconds when not playing

### Playing Soccer
1. Start playing - the system is always ready
2. When a goal is scored, the IR sensor detects it immediately
3. LED strip shows a 5-second celebration in team colors:
   - **Team A Goal**: Red wave celebration
   - **Team B Goal**: Blue wave celebration
4. Score is automatically tracked and displayed in Serial Monitor
5. After celebration, demo effects resume

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### LED Effects
You can modify the available effects in `led-controller.h`:
- `LED_FULL_WHITE` - All sections white
- `LED_COLOR_WAVE` - Colored wave animation  
- `LED_RAINBOW_WAVE` - Rainbow wave effect
- `LED_BREATHING` - Breathing/fade effect

### Timing Settings
Adjust timing in the header files:
```cpp
#define CELEBRATION_DURATION 5000    // Goal celebration length (ms)
#define IR_DEBOUNCE_TIME 500         // Goal detection debounce (ms)
#define WAVE_SPEED 50                // Wave animation speed
```

### Team Colors
Change team colors in `led-controller.h`:
```cpp
#define TEAM_A_COLOR CRGB::Red       // Team A color
#define TEAM_B_COLOR CRGB::Blue      // Team B color
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### LED Strip Issues
- **No LEDs lighting**: Check 5V power supply and data pin connection
- **Wrong colors**: Verify `COLOR_ORDER` in led-controller.h (try RGB vs GRB)
- **Flickering**: Ensure stable 5V power supply with sufficient amperage

### IR Sensor Issues
- **No goal detection**: Check sensor wiring and position
- **False triggers**: Increase `IR_DEBOUNCE_TIME` or adjust sensor sensitivity
- **Sensors always triggered**: Check pull-up resistors and sensor polarity

### WiFi Issues
- **Won't connect**: Verify SSID and password in wifi-controller.cpp
- **Slow connection**: Normal, system continues running during connection

### Serial Monitor
- Use 9600 baud rate
- Check USB cable and driver installation
- Verify correct COM port selection

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Add More Effects
Create custom LED effects by adding new cases to the `updateLEDs()` function in `led-controller.cpp`.

### Web Interface
The WiFi functionality enables adding a web server for:
- Remote score monitoring
- LED effect control
- Game statistics

### MQTT Integration
Add MQTT publishing for:
- Real-time score updates
- Goal events
- System status

## 📊 Power Consumption

- **ESP32**: ~240mA (WiFi active)
- **LED Strip**: Up to 18A at full white (300 LEDs × 60mA)
- **IR Sensors**: ~20mA each

**Recommended**: 5V 20A power supply for full brightness operation.
